# Additional Info
Due to .gitignore necessary files containing sensitive infornmation are ommitted from this final commit
So you will need to include the following file:
* .env -> Can be used to store university login details e.g. LOGOIN_USERNAME=u04ty34 LOGIN_PASSWORD=Spuderman777 (not my details so dont even try)
* a credentials.json file -> This is obtained when you create and verify a project with your gmail account in Google cloud console
* token.json -> This is generate when running the code in schedule_tasks.py

# Reasons for making this 
To practice webscraping and automated scheduling on windows :)
